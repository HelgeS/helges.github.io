Hi, I'm a PhD Student at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no/) in Oslo, Norway.
My work is funded by the Certus Centre for Software Validation and Verification ([Certus SFI](http://www.certus-sfi.no/)).

Research Interests
======

My research interests are in the application of Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning, especially in the domain of Software Testing. I'm further
interested in the integration of traditional AI methods, such as Constraint
Programming, and Machine Learning.

Publications
